Arsenic is considered by the World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) as one of the ten chemicals of greatest public health concern  and poses far higher health risks than any other known environmental pollutant in the world. The study by Yuan, 2007 showed that roughly one out of 10 people can die because of high concentrations of arsenic in water . Human exposure to elevated levels of inorganic arsenic occurs mainly through the consumption of groundwater that naturally contains high levels of inorganic arsenic, food prepared with this water and food crops irrigated with high-arsenic polluted.

Effects of long-term exposure to arsenic have been documented in several studies:
